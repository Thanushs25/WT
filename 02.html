    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is a discipline of Computer Science and Information
        Technology concerned with creating intelligent computers and systems that accomplish tasks that previously
        required human intelligence. AI and MLare beginning to infiltrate our daily lives and their potential continues
        to rise. Many industries like banking, finance, manufacturing, automobile, healthcare and cybersecurity are
        sprouting with ample opportunities for AI and ML.

        The AI software industry grew 54% globally in 2020 and is expected to expand over 40% every year from now
        through 2023. This indicates that the future of AI and ML is undoubtedly bright.
