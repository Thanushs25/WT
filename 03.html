    <img src="D:\WT\header.png" alt="Error!" height="150px" width="1500px">
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS) is a new field of study that deals with extracting knowledge
        from data using processes, methodologies and techniques drawn from various domains such as statistics, cognitive
        science and computing and information science. It is a specialized field that deals with the creation of data
        driven solutions that are used in various industries including banking, transportation, logistics, health care
        and customer service. <br> <br>

        AI and Data Science are heralding cutting-edge new solutions for businesses and everyday life, varying from
        SMART gadgets to Netflix recommendations and products like Amazonâ€™s Alexa and Google Home. According to a study,
        AI and Data Science technologies are used in some form by 77% of the products that we use on a daily basis.
        <br><br>

        During the period of study, students will learn Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics, Data Visualization,
        Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Social Network Analytics, Data Security and Privacy and other related subjects.
        <br><br>
